# Set default behaviour, in case users don't have core.autocrlf set.

# If you want to override this setting locally,
# for example on Windows you want the files in your working tree
# to use `lf` and not `crlf`, make a setting in `$GIT_DIR/info/attributes`
# `* text eol=lf` is the relevant setting to force `lf` in checkedout text
# files on Windows.

* text=auto

# Explicitly declare text files we want to always be normalized and converted 
# to native line endings on checkout.
